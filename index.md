## CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was a favorite because it was one of the first programs I wrote using different functions. It was a Black Jack game and I was able to understand how the game worked. I also learned to use the try and catch functions for exception handling. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2 was another favorite because I learned to create a file and write text to it. This program was about writing a "secret message" into a file. I learned to use the fstream data type to copy a message from the command line into the file created. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, Part 2 was an amazing program where I learned to create a GIF image. I used a random number generator along with for-loops to give every pixel in the GIF image a different color in a series of five images. In this lab, I strengthened my skills with the Magick Library.
